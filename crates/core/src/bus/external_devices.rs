//! The canonical external-device resolution order, shared by every machine-
//! construction path (`SystemBus::from_config`, the Xtensa attacher) so the
//! precedence can never drift between chips:
//!
//!   1. manifest-carried parts (`parts:`, `part_pack`) — most specific wins
//!   2. the `PeripheralKit` registry — the engine's built-in catalog
//!   3. declarative `configs/devices/*.yaml` descriptors
//!
//! Anything still unclaimed returns [`UniversalResolution::Unrecognized`] and
//! the CALLER decides the policy (a legacy factory, chip-specific arms, a
//! hard error). History: this order used to be re-implemented per chip
//! family; the copies diverged (a shadowed OLED arm resolved the same
//! manifest differently per chip, and an unknown type warned-and-skipped on
//! one path while erroring on another). One copy now.
